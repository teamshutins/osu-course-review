# osu-course-review (Sprint 2 Pair 2 - Taka's part)
This version implements the updated "Course Description Screen" which reads the data from the JSON file.

############ NOTE ################

When you first run this code on your IDE (VS Code), please make sure to run “Flutter clean” (on VS Code’s terminal) before running the app.

Also, after the first run, when you update then later re-run the app, you may still see the old version of the app is opening. 
If that happens, please run “Flutter clean” again. This will clean up the old version of the app installed on the Android emulator.
